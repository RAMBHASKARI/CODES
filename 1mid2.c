// what are the system created stream ?

//  when the c program is started ,3 stream are implicitly created.
// these are known as built-in stream created stream 
        // stdio
        // stdout
        // stderr

// in stdio.h header file, these are declared. we can't declear them in the program 

// stdin points to the standard input stream that associates with the keybord

// stdout points to the standard output steram that associates with the monitor

// stderr points to the standard error steram that associates with the monitor

// there is no need to open and close these standard stream .it is done automatically by the operating system
